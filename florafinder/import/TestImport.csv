Northern Rata,,"Northern rātā (Metrosideros robusta) is a huge forest tree endemic to New Zealand. It grows up to 25 metres (82 ft) or taller, and usually begins its life as a hemiepiphyte high in the branches of a mature forest tree; over centuries the young tree sends descending and girdling roots down and around the trunk of its host, eventually forming a massive, frequently hollow pseudotrunk composed of fused roots. In disturbed ground, or where there are gaps in the forest cover, Northern rātā will grow on the ground with a normal but short trunk.",5,8,2,3,,,Paired,Smooth,,"Leaves are green underneath, unlike the white of the Pohutukawa",Red,,,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metrosideros_robusta,northernrata_main.jpg
